## File description

### AB-test conversion increase 

[AB-test_conversion_increase.parquet.gzip]() is a database of 451,181 fictional web-events over three months, from an ecommerce site. The site is running an A/B test and “Treatment” is leading to a presumably significant increase in conversion rate. This dataset can be used to demonstrate how to go from raw events to statistical results, and discuss lead and lagging metrics, user retention, sample ratio mismatch (SRM) and sequential testing.
